# spaghetto

The next iteration of [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago).

This project is still _extremely_ alpha-quality software, use at your own risk.

## Installing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci
# For bootstrap
npm install -g purescript-spaghetto
# From here on you can use the `./spaghetto` script to run the local version, e.g.:
./spaghetto build
```
